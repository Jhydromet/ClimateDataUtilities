# Daymet has a 365 day calendar with dec 31 trimmed on leap years. This script will correct the .nc metadata to reflect the 365_day calendar, and correct for the missing leap year timestamps by forcing a continuous timestep.

# The script is meant to be ran after merging .nc files together (I used cdo mergetime).

# Best route - 365_day calendar -------------------------------------------

# re-establish the date sequence as 365 day years. shift dates back to account for missing leap dates.

# set 365_day calendar type
